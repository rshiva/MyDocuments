Thanks for downloading! The easiest way to understand how this unlock one layer at a time and view it's position in the first frame and then it's destination in the last frame. By creating a motion tween with shape, you get a very smooth transition between frames, and makes the globe appear to spin. You can apply this technique to tons of other stuff. 3D footbals, blimps... anything round really. E-mail me with your questons and/or opinions. Have fun.
