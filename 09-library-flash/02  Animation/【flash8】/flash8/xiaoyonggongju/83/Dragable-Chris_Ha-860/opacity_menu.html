<!--Dragable, Sizeable, Mouse-Over menu for www.opacitydesign.com When I was just beginning flash, the concept of a menu like this was very difficult for me to understand.  Hopefully this will help anyone that is looking to learn.  This is the exact menu on my site. The menu is composed of individual mouse-over buttons, all with their own specific instructions on-press. By using 'tell target', this menu is very easy to implement on your own site.   Simply drag and drop "menu_movie" onto your site, double click on it, and name the instance "themenu".  T In the library (ctrl-L), you can see how the menu is composed of invidivual buttons into one master movie.   The plus and minus signs use the movie properties X_Scale & Y_scale This is pretty simple, really, and looks great and only takes up 6k! If you have any questions, contact me through my website -chris. http://www.opacitydesign.com menu --><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
