1. What are the free Flash files?

     They are what we call "cookies". Small and sweet :-)

2. Why are we doing them? And for what purpose?

     These files are not tutorials, they were never meant to be. When we have
     time to spare, we experiment with Flash in order to better understand it
     and to create something nice/interesting.

     We thought that others could benefit from them too, so we have opened a 
     new section within our site and offered these files for free download to 
     play with and maybe /learn/ a bit.

     You may not redistribute the source file in any form (like offering it for
