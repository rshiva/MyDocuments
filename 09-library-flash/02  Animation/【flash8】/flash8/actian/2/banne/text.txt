&text=You can customize this Flash banner by editing the words in the "text.txt" file. You don't even have to open up the .fla if you don't want to.
BUT remember, you must NOT remove these three things in the text file:
The first one is the word "delay=" in the first line. This is the delay time for each messages. You can adjust this as you see fit.
The second one is the word "text=" in the second line. This is where you type in your messages.
The last one is the last line (that "eof=true" thing). This line marks the end of the messages.
Open the "text.txt" in Notepad to edit the messages.
You can put put as many sentences as you like. But remember that since the height of the banner is 60 pixels, it can only get 3 lines of sentences at a time.
Every message is separated by ENTER.
You can use this banner for other purposes (news flash, credits, etc.) Just play around with it. It's pretty fun. ;)
