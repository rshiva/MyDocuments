Everything's up for grabs except for the actual artwork. I used Bryce for the artwork. The artwork is copyright protected, but rip the movie apart and have fun with everything else, lots of good menu ideas in this one. You'll see that if you open up the FLA and export it there's a couple more things going on then what's in the original swf. Make sure "Slammin2.swf" is in your folder, that's where the sounds are.
Have fun, e-mail me if you have any questions
