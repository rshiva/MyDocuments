<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT 
face=Arial>Here is a snapshot of the menu being used to load one of 
HUNDREDS of chalk drawings I did for one of the large grocery chains up in 
Canada. (Yep I'm Canadian). When you click on the menu item, the OnRelease 
script gets the name of the button you just clicked on, then performs 
a&nbsp;LOADMOVIE "/"&amp;button_name&amp;".swf" into&nbsp;the location you see. 
This way you can keep the size of your main file small, and keep the contents 
easily changeable. In the original project, the variables were loaded from a 
text file.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>             Since this is as close to a 
tutorial             as I 
can come (it's not much of a tutorial but lots of complicated flash code) I stripped 
out all the fancy bits and just entered the variables manually in Frame 1 
of the main timeline. I also removed the button actions. 
The whole thing is as simplified as I could get 
it and well Commented to help you understand what is going on.<BR></STRONG></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG><FONT size=4>Interesting Notes on this 
Project:</FONT></STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial><BR>Originally, I had also embedded an alphabetical sort 
routine to alphabetize the menu items. In the screen snapshot you can see THEY 
ARE NOT sorted! This is because my alphabetical sort generated more than 200,000 
calculations in one action list. Now, I'm not quite sure what this means, but 
for some reason Macromedia saw fit to cause a permanent stop to all actions 
after that event occurs. Now, that seemed to occur after I tried sorting roughly 
90 items. If anyone has a workaround for this problem PLEASE TELL ME!!! <FONT 
color=mediumblue>(I tried compartmentalizing the sort across multiple frames and 
using "Go To Frame..." to get to the next set of commands but Flash was too 
smart for me here and STILL saw all those calculations as one action list. Any 
ideas out there I'd LOVE to hear from you.)</FONT>    
            
              
             
               
              
      </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>That's why I removed the sort. The alphabetical sort is still 
available however, as a separate tutorial</FONT><FONT face=Arial>         
                
              
               
               
on VFX. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This project, even WITHOUT the hundreds of linked "swf" 
files that load as you click on these buttons, was still over 23MB in Flash. Let 
me tell you from this experience, <STRONG>Flash does not like that much 
information!!!</STRONG> I ran into all sorts of problems with MINUTES of lag in using the Library and the publish feature crashed 
the 23MB file Flash on the Mac. It still worked on the PC however. 
In the end, it all worked and everyone involved lived happily ever after.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The final product was part of a catalog that shipped on 
CD-ROM as a sales tool of all the chalk drawings I'd done. It worked fine as an 
".exe" file. But I think Macromedia had Director in mind for that size of 
project!!!</FONT></P>
